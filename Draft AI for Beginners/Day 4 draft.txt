# Day 4: Prompting Basics, Safety & Responsible Use

How to Communicate with AI Clearly, Safely, and Responsibly

---

## Slide 1 — Title Slide

**Prompting Basics, Safety & Responsible Use**
From Understanding Models to Using AI Responsibly

Workshop: AI for Beginners (Day 4)

**Speaker Notes:**
Welcome to the final day. Explain that today turns understanding into practical control. Emphasize that prompting is about clarity and responsibility, not tricks or shortcuts.

---

## Slide 2 — How Prompting Fits Everything We Learned

* AI models don’t understand intent
* They respond only to instructions
* Prompting is how humans guide models

**Speaker Notes:**
Reconnect to Day 3: models are engines, prompting is the steering wheel. Without clear steering, even powerful engines go off track.

---

## Slide 3 — What Prompting Is NOT

Prompting is NOT:

* Programming
* Magic commands
* Guaranteed correctness
* A replacement for thinking

**Speaker Notes:**
Lower expectations deliberately. This prevents overtrust and frustration.

---

## Slide 4 — What Prompting IS

Prompting IS:

* Structured communication
* Providing context
* Defining expectations
* Guiding output quality

**Speaker Notes:**
Use a human analogy: clearer instructions lead to better outcomes.

---

## Slide 5 — Why AI Needs Explicit Instructions

* AI has no goals
* AI has no awareness of importance
* AI does not infer priorities

**Speaker Notes:**
Explain that humans infer intent naturally; AI does not. This explains why vague prompts fail.

---

## Slide 6 — The Core Prompting Framework

**R–T–C Framework**

* **Role:** Who should the AI act as?
* **Task:** What should it do?
* **Constraints:** How should it respond?

**Speaker Notes:**
Keep this framework simple and repeatable. This is the only framework beginners need.

---

## Slide 7 — Role: Setting Perspective

Examples:

* “You are an HR manager…”
* “You are a customer support agent…”
* “You are a technical writer…”

**Speaker Notes:**
Explain that role sets tone, vocabulary, and assumptions.

---

## Slide 8 — Task: Being Explicit

Good task descriptions:

* Clear objective
* Single responsibility
* Action-oriented

**Speaker Notes:**
Explain that vague tasks lead to generic answers.

---

## Slide 9 — Constraints: Reducing Ambiguity

Constraints can include:

* Length
* Tone
* Format
* Audience

**Speaker Notes:**
Explain that constraints narrow the output space and improve relevance.

---

## Slide 10 — Example: Weak vs Strong Prompt

**Weak:**
“Write an email.”

**Strong:**
“You are a sales manager. Write a polite follow-up email to a client after a meeting. Keep it under 150 words.”

**Speaker Notes:**
Walk through why the strong prompt works better using RTC.

---

## Slide 11 — Iteration Is Normal

* First output is a draft
* Ask for refinement
* Adjust tone or format

**Speaker Notes:**
Reinforce that iteration is expected, not failure.

---

## Slide 12 — Common Prompting Mistakes

* Too vague
* Too many tasks at once
* Assuming context
* Blindly trusting output

**Speaker Notes:**
Use examples participants can relate to from emails or instructions.

---

## Slide 13 — AI Hallucinations Explained

* AI may generate false information
* Sounds confident even when wrong
* Happens due to probability-based generation

**Speaker Notes:**
Tie back to Day 2 and Day 3. This is a core risk.

---

## Slide 14 — How to Reduce Hallucinations

* Ask for sources
* Ask AI to say “I don’t know”
* Break tasks into steps
* Verify critical information

**Speaker Notes:**
Stress that verification is a human responsibility.

---

## Slide 15 — Data Privacy & Security

Do NOT share:

* Passwords
* Personal identifiers
* Confidential company data
* Financial details

**Speaker Notes:**
Explain that public tools may store or learn from inputs.

---

## Slide 16 — Ethical Use of AI

* Avoid discrimination
* Avoid misinformation
* Respect intellectual property
* Maintain human accountability

**Speaker Notes:**
Keep ethics practical, not philosophical.

---

## Slide 17 — Where AI Helps Most (Realistic View)

AI is best for:

* Drafting
* Summarizing
* Brainstorming
* Structuring information

**Speaker Notes:**
Reinforce assistant mindset.

---

## Slide 18 — Where AI Should NOT Decide Alone

* Hiring decisions
* Legal judgments
* Financial approvals
* Medical advice

**Speaker Notes:**
Clear boundaries protect both people and organizations.

---

## Slide 19 — Personal AI Usage Checklist

Before using AI output:

* Is this factual?
* Is this appropriate?
* Is this verified?
* Am I accountable?

**Speaker Notes:**
Encourage participants to adopt this checklist mentally.

---

## Slide 20 — Final Workshop Takeaways

* AI is powerful but limited
* Models respond to instructions
* Prompting is communication
* Humans remain responsible

**Speaker Notes:**
Close confidently. Reinforce empowerment, not fear.

---

## Slide 21 — Final Homework & Next Steps

**Task:**

* Identify 3 tasks where AI can help you
* Write one RTC prompt for each
* Commit to safe usage

**Speaker Notes:**
Frame this as a beginning, not an end.
