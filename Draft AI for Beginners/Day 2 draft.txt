# Day 2: AI vs Generative AI

Understanding What Changed and Why It Matters

---

## Slide 1 — Title Slide

**AI vs Generative AI**
What Changed, What Didn’t, and Why It Matters

Workshop: AI for Beginners (Day 2)

**Speaker Notes:**
Welcome back. Briefly recap Day 1: AI evolved from rules to learning to generation. Today focuses on a critical distinction—traditional AI versus Generative AI. This understanding prevents confusion, overtrust, and misuse.

---

## Slide 2 — Quick Recap from Day 1

* AI did not appear suddenly
* AI works on data and patterns
* AI does not think or understand
* Generative AI is the latest phase

**Speaker Notes:**
Reinforce continuity. Emphasize that Generative AI is not a replacement of old AI, but an extension built on top of it.

---

## Slide 3 — Why This Distinction Matters

* Expectations change based on understanding
* Misuse happens when we assume AI understands
* Decisions based on wrong assumptions are risky

**Speaker Notes:**
Explain that many AI failures come from misunderstanding what the system is designed to do. Correct mental models lead to safer usage.

---

## Slide 4 — What Is Traditional AI?

Traditional AI is designed to:

* Analyze data
* Recognize patterns
* Predict outcomes
* Make recommendations

**Speaker Notes:**
Clarify that traditional AI is task-specific. It is very good at one thing, not general intelligence.

---

## Slide 5 — Examples of Traditional AI

* Spam filtering
* Fraud detection
* Recommendation systems
* Credit scoring
* Face recognition

**Speaker Notes:**
Point out that these systems usually work silently in the background and do not interact with users conversationally.

---

## Slide 6 — What Traditional AI Cannot Do

* Write essays
* Hold conversations
* Create original images
* Adapt to open-ended tasks

**Speaker Notes:**
Emphasize boundaries. These systems operate within strict definitions and outputs.

---

## Slide 7 — Enter Generative AI

Generative AI is designed to:

* Create new content
* Work with language naturally
* Handle open-ended tasks
* Interact conversationally

**Speaker Notes:**
Frame GenAI as a shift in interface. Humans can now talk to machines using natural language.

---

## Slide 8 — What Does “Generative” Mean?

* Generates text, images, code, audio, video
* Outputs are *new*, not copied
* Based on learned patterns

**Speaker Notes:**
Clarify that generation is not copying from a database. It is probabilistic creation based on training patterns.

---

## Slide 9 — Why Generative AI Feels Intelligent

* Uses human language
* Responds fluently
* Adapts tone and style

**Speaker Notes:**
Warn that fluency creates an illusion of understanding. This illusion is the biggest risk with GenAI.

---

## Slide 10 — Under the Hood (Conceptual)

* Predicts the *next word* or *next element*
* Chooses the most likely continuation
* Repeats this step-by-step

**Speaker Notes:**
Keep this high-level. Avoid math. The key idea: prediction, not reasoning.

---

## Slide 11 — Comparison: AI vs Generative AI

**Traditional AI**

* Predicts
* Classifies
* Recommends
* Narrow tasks

**Generative AI**

* Writes
* Creates
* Explains
* Handles open-ended tasks

**Speaker Notes:**
This slide is a mental anchor. Encourage participants to remember this comparison.

---

## Slide 12 — Strengths of Generative AI

* Speed
* Drafting ability
* Language fluency
* Creativity support

**Speaker Notes:**
Position GenAI as an assistant, not an authority.

---

## Slide 13 — Weaknesses of Generative AI

* Hallucinations
* Confidently wrong answers
* Bias from training data
* No real-world understanding

**Speaker Notes:**
Stress that confidence does not equal correctness. This sets up Day 4 discussions.

---

## Slide 14 — AI That You See vs AI That You Don’t

**Visible AI:**

* Chatbots
* Image generators

**Invisible AI:**

* Search ranking
* Pricing algorithms
* Risk scoring

**Speaker Notes:**
Explain that most AI still operates invisibly. GenAI just made AI visible and approachable.

---

## Slide 15 — Why Generative AI Became Mainstream

* Easy access
* Natural language interface
* Low learning curve
* Immediate results

**Speaker Notes:**
Explain that usability—not intelligence alone—drove adoption.

---

## Slide 16 — What GenAI Is NOT

* Not a human
* Not a decision-maker
* Not a source of truth
* Not a replacement for judgment

**Speaker Notes:**
Reinforce responsibility. Humans remain accountable for decisions.

---

## Slide 17 — When to Use Which

Use **Traditional AI** when:

* Decisions must be consistent
* Accuracy is critical

Use **Generative AI** when:

* Drafting or ideation is needed
* Speed matters more than perfection

**Speaker Notes:**
Help participants choose the right tool for the right job.

---

## Slide 18 — Common Myths About Generative AI

* “It understands me”
* “It is always correct”
* “It replaces expertise”

**Speaker Notes:**
Debunk gently. Avoid fear-based messaging.

---

## Slide 19 — Key Takeaways (Day 2)

* Traditional AI predicts; GenAI creates
* GenAI feels intelligent but is probabilistic
* Strengths and weaknesses must be understood

**Speaker Notes:**
Connect these takeaways to upcoming prompting lessons.

---

## Slide 20 — Homework

**Task:**

* Ask an AI tool to explain something you already know well
* Note one thing it explains well
* Note one thing it gets wrong or vague

**Speaker Notes:**
Explain that this homework trains critical thinking, not usage skill.
